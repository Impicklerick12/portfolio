## Purpose

The purpose of building this website was to showcase my web development progress and use all the newly acquired skills of HTML and CSS(SASS). In todays world, a professional online body of work is essential for all creative industries, not only does it showcase your work but it also provides a platform for interested guests to communicate with you. This portfolio was built to highlight the projects I have already undertaken, but also to act as a base for furture enhancements as my tech stack grows. In time I will be expanding on this, adding new pages, changing the styling, and incorporating new frameworks. I would love add new content which includes my commercial photography work which I have previously showcased in a portfolio online.

## Functionality/Features

The site was initially designed as a 4-page website, which includes a landing page, web development page, blogs page and contact page. Navigation through the pages is done using the page title icons on the header nav bar which is fixed to the top of the page. The nav bar is responsive to all devices, where the header links are styled into a hidden block list which can be accessed through the hamburger menu icon. The new navigation list is displayed full screen from the left using CSS animation and styling.

The website elements are styled mostly using CSS flex-box, as I found it an incredibly versitile method for organisation. Each flex-box has a max-width value which will adjust according to the media quieres

## Target Audience

This website was created to represent my web development body of work. Itâ€™s purpose is to display all relevant skills and projects undertaken, as well as giving the guest an insight into my personality and interests. My portfolio is targeted at potential employers, clients, peers and family, and any other professionals looking to assess my body of work. 
#

## Tech Stack

For this project, I utilised HTML5 and CSS to build and style my website. SASS was used as a CSS pre-processor, which was incredibly handy being able to reduce the written CSS. Flex-box was used to style and organise all elements on each page. The portfolio was deployed on Netlify.
