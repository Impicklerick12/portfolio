## Alternate Fonts Branch

This branch was created to alter the fonts used across the website. I chose the serif style 'Volkhov' font as the main headings font, which I like quite a lot. The serif style does display a more professional style which I may push to the master repo. Also I changed the paragraph font to the google font 'Roboto' which has a nice clean structure. These fonts pair well together, and as I mentioned I may utilize them in the master repo.
