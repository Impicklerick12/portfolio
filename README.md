## Photography Branch

My photography work is something I would love to incorporate accross my portfolio. In this branch I added a page photography.html which is a duplicate of the blogs page. I then edited the page slightly to include a CSS carosel of some of my favourite photos. This is something I will definitely be working on in the future, displaying all of my landscape and commercial photography as a sepparate page in my portfolio.
