## Alternate Colourway Branch

This branch was created to reverse the main colour colour palette of the website. Instead of the predominantly deep blue header and dark orange feature colour, I switched the order. Now the dark orange is used as the header/footer colour and the deep blues are used as the link colours. 

Although it does add lightness and vibrancy to the website, I believe the more subtle palette utilizing the blues with the dark orange as the feature works best.
